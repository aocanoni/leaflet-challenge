# leaflet-challenge
UCI data analytics bootcamp module 15 leaflet challenge

All my code for the project is within the 'static' folder and the index.html

- the static folder has a 'js' folder and a 'logic.js' file and contains all my javascript code for the assignment
- the static folder also contains a 'css' folder and a 'style.css' file that ccontains both starter_code and code I created based on the documentation from leaflet
- the 'index.html' has code I created based off of class activities

***All the code within this repostitory is solely my own created based on the resources I mentioned above as well as the Xpert Learning Assistant.
